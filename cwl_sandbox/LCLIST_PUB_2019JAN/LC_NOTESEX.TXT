        AKARI                          This note applies to all 'AKARI' details records. The Usui
                                       (2011) paper (AKARI/IRC Survey) used H values from Lowell
                                       Observatory's ASTORB file and assumed ± 0.05 mag error. In
                                       some cases, using the stated values for albedo and diameter
                                       in the standard formulae to compute H (see LCDB README) does
                                       not give the ASTORB value of H, usually differing by
                                       0.01-0.02 mag.

        Carry 2010a                    Density = 3.4 ± 0.9 g/cc.  Dimensions: a = 275 ± 4 km; b =
                                       258 ± 3 km; c = 238 ± 3 km.

        Durech 2011a                   This applies to all entries for Durech 2011a. All but 14 of
                                       the spin axis values in Durech 2011a are assumed values taken
                                       from the literature. See the original paper for specifics.

        Hanus 2017b                    Hanus 2017b is based on combining photometric, adaptive
                                       optics, and occulation observations.

        Pravec 2012b                   This note applies to all Pravec 2012b entries. In almost all
                                       cases, the original Pravec values were H_R. The H_V values
                                       were derived using assumed V-R values from various sources
                                       based on known taxonomic class or orbital position. If a
                                       diameter and albedo are given, these are revised values based
                                       on the original WISE H, G, D, and pV, corrected using the new
                                       H-G values and Harris and Harris (1997).

                                       albedo derived from WISE data.

                                       from DAMIT web site). The pole solution is still in close
                                       agreement with other solutions.

        Trilling 2010                  The Trilling (2010) results are based on using values for H
                                       taken from the JPL Horizons site. In Trilling (2010), there
                                       is often a significant disagreement among the albedo,
                                       diameter, and H values when they are applied to the standard
                                       formula that relates these three values (see LCDB README
                                       file), i.e., using the Trilling albedo and diameter values
                                       gives a differnt value for H than stated, sometimes by up to
                                       0.1 mag.

        Chang 2016                     Chang (2016) H values are based on H-G system. The G values
                                       are in R, not V. All lightcurves with a period were initially
                                       given U = 2 regardless of rating by Chang et al. The plots
                                       for the 352 lightcurves that did not have complete coverage
                                       were reviewed and the U codes revised. In many of those
                                       cases, it appears that the half-period was found. For those,
                                       if the summary line depended on the Chang et al. entry, the
                                       period on the summary line is double that found by Chang et
                                       al. and carries a 'D' (determined) flag in the NOTES field.
                                       No errors were given for amplitudes, which were often
                                       dramatically overstated.

        Chang (2016) H values are based on H-G system. The G values are in R, not V. All lightcurves
        with a period were initially given U = 2 regardless of rating by Chang et al. The plots for
        the 352 lightcurves that did not have complete coverage were reviewed and the U codes
        revised. In many of those cases, it appears that the half-period was found. For those, if
        the summary line depended on the Chang et al. entry, the period on the summary line is
        double that found by Chang et al. and carries a 'D' (determined) flag in the NOTES field. No
        errors were given for amplitudes, which were often dramatically overstated.

                                       radar observations. Paper proved spin up due to YORP effect.

        Franco 2011web                 Author gave P = 6.70 h for a monomodal solution. The
                                       amplitude virtually assures a bimodal curve and, therefore,
                                       double the reported period.

        The Schierich (2009) results use previous lightcurve data to model the satellite:primary
        size ratio (D2/D1), pole of the orbital plane, and sidereal period of the orbit. The spin
        axis pole of the primary is considered to be the same as that of the orbit, i.e., the orbit
        lies in the primary's equatorial plane.

        Warner 2015g                   No events seen and not likely so because of the long second
                                       period. The long period is attributed to the primary body
                                       while the short period is presumed to be due to the rotation
                                       of the fully asynchronous satellite.

        Warner 2010e                   The short period, low amplitude component of the lightcurve
                                       may be due to a widely separated component of a binary that
                                       is a relatively small and irregularly shaped, or a larger but
                                       more regularly shaped body.   If a binary, the period of the
                                       orbit cannot be determined from the observations but is
                                       probably long based on the absence of mutual events and
                                       asynchronous rotation of the two components.  The
                                       low-amplitude component of the lightcurve is U = 1/1+. This
                                       applies not only to the quality of the solution for the
                                       component but to the probability of the asteroid being binary
                                       as well.

        delay range. However, the images indicate the possibility of a bifurcated body with an
        effective diameter of about 1.5 km. Based on the total information, we presumed a dark
        (C-type) asteroid and used the default albedo for that class and MPCORB H to derive a
        diameter.

                                       the two periods do not have a simple integral multiple ratio.

        Dermawan 2002b, Doctoral Thesis This paper included approximately 50 objects, named in this
        list as DermXx, with X being a number and x a letter. The paper used the following values,
        which were adopted in lieu of the defaults used in this publication that are based on the
        semi-major axis:  SMA: 2.3 < a < 2.8, Type = C, V-R = 0.53±0.04, Pv = 0.21±0.05;   SMA: 2.8
        < a < 3.3, Type = C, V-R = 0.37±0.03, Pv = 0.06±0.02.  The listed diameters are those listed
        by Dermawan as computed from these assumed values and his measured value of Hv.
