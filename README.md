# CometGPs

Using Gaussian Processes to model the light curves of asteroids and 
comets.

We would like to:
* reliably detect periods and estimate their uncertainties with sparse data
* reliable estimate the amplitude of the variations and its uncertainties
* (future): take into account trends in the pulse profile and the overall light curve shape
* (future): think about forecasting where ideal future observations should take place
 
Current dependencies (beyond anaconda3)
* corner
* dynesty 
* george
* emcee
* gatspy
