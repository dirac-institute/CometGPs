\begin{abstract}
We propose to obtain dense, continuous time sampling of 10 main belt asteroids with LCO as follow up to sparse light curve sampling obtained with ZTF. The extremely well-characterized light curve segment from LCO will serve to validate Gaussian Process techniques we are developing to analyze sparse asteroid light curves from surveys like ZTF or LSST.

These Gaussian Process methods provide formal error estimates on asteroid rotation periods, as well as allowing us to account for non-sinusoidal period profiles, and (in future work) fit for colors, phase curves and shape models when using survey data from a multi-band, long-term survey such as ZTF or LSST. Obtaining LCO data to supplement the ZTF data while developing these algorithms will provide invaluable real-world tests of our methods.

\sciencejustification
periods of asteroids tells us about their internal structure the shape
of the light curve also gives us important clues as to their shape
being able to fit the phase curve and potential color variations at
the same time is important for future surveys (phase curve varies with
family, color variations complicate light curve)

Current methods of fitting asteroid sparse light curves include
fourier analysis of the light curve amplitudes (such as with FALC),
Lomb-Scargle (L-S) fitting, and Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM)
analysis (see {\it e.g.} Waszczak et al, \aj\, 2015, Polishook et al,
MNRAS 2012, Harris et al, Icarus 2012, Warner \& Harris, Icarus 2011,
Masiero et al, Icarus 2009, Mann et al, \aj\, 2007). These methods have
varying drawbacks, but in general do not provide a proper statistical
estimate of the error of the parameters which are fit. In order to
determine a formal statistical error, a generative model must be used;
Gaussian Processes combined with Monte Carlo provide such a method.
[Daniela say something smart here?]

These Gaussian Process methods are intended to discover the light
curve periodicity as well as the shape of the light curve (including
non-sinusoidal light curve profiles), even in sparse data obtained
with only a few data points in distinct nights. This is a technique
required to characterize asteroids observed with LSST and is under
development by teams at University of Washington and the DIRAC
Institute. We intend to continue to develop this technique to also fit
for phase function variation, potential tumbling, and multi-color
observations, in order to provide a useful tool for determining
periods, spin axes, shapes and colors for surveys such as ZTF and
LSST.

% EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
%
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% There is a limit of one page of printed text.

% Describe your overall observational program.  How will these 
% observations contribute toward the accomplishment of the goals 
% outlined in the science justification?  If you've requested 
% long-term status, justify why this is necessary for successful 
% completion of the science.
%
% NOTE: In previous versions of the proposal form, this section
% requested details about the use of non-NOAO observing facilities. 
% Such information should now be entered in the following "Other
% Facilities" section.

\expdesign
The observations we are proposing to obtain with LCO are intended to
densely sample the light curve, following up on the sparse sampling
obtained with ZTF.

We will use our Gaussian Process technique on the sparsely sampled data
obtained with ZTF, but need densely sampled light curves over a full
rotation period to verify the results, especially non-sinusoidal
features in the light curve profile. 

We expect ZTF to observe more than a thousand main belt asteroids
brighter than $r=20$ in the region between 290 and 0 degrees RA and 
+10 and -30 degrees Declination, consistent with the footprint of the
ZTF survey, avoiding the galaxy, and suitable for LCO observations with
the 1-m network between June and Dec 2018. This provides plenty of
potential targets, with a range of expected light curve periods,
profiles and amplitudes. We will choose a sample of approximately 10
objects which provide the best challenge to the Gaussian Process method
development, with a range of periods between 2 and 10 hours. 

To gather data to fully sample the light curve over the entire rotation
period, and to maintain sensitivity to non-sinusoidal elements in the
light curve, we need to continually observe the targets for at least
two light curve periods. By sampling two light curve periods, we can
remove ambiguities due to the possibility of either the light-curve
originating from a rotation period (a `double-peaked' light curve) or
albedo variations (a `single-peaked' light curve).  By continually
observing the object, we are sensitive to non-sinusoidal variations in
the light curve profile. LCO is unique in its capabilities to
continually observe a target for longer than a few hours, due to its
global distribution of telescopes, and is thus an ideal resource for
this project. Although we can recover from missed observations due to
local weather conditions, the ideal situation would be to observe each
target continually throughout a 4-20 hour time period (depending on the
rotation period of each asteroid). 

A SNR of about 20 is required in order to obtain photometry with
uncertainties small enough to accurately determine the light curve. At
r=20, with Sinistro used on the 1-m telescopes, this is possible to
achieve with exposure times of about 176 seconds during `half' bright
time (estimated using the LCO Exposure Time Calculator) or 124 seconds
during dark time, which provides a reasonable sampling rate (218
seconds, including readout) for these multi-hour light curves. 

Depending on the light curve profile and possible ambiguities between
light curve period and rotation period, we may request alternating
observations in g and r band. For targets with no ambiguity between
double- and single- peaked light curves, but with complexity in their
light curve profile, we will observe in just r band.


% PROPRIETARY PERIOD

% Enter the proprietary period for your data between the braces.

% OTHER FACILITIES OR RESOURCES
% 
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% Please limit to about a half page of printed text.
% 
% 1) We are interested in understanding how observations made through
% NOAO observing opportunities complement or support data from other
% facilities both on the ground and in space.   We will use this
% information to guide the evolution of the NOAO program; it will not
% affect the success of your proposal in the evaluation process.
% Please describe how the proposed observations complement data from  
% other facilities, including private observatories and both ground-
% and space-based telescopes.  In addressing this question, take a
% broad view of your research program.  Are the data to be obtained 
% through this proposal going to help select samples for detailed
% observations using larger telescopes or from space observatories?
% Are these data going to be directly combined with data obtained
% elsewhere to test a hypothesis?  Will these observations have
% relevance to other observations, even though the proposal stands
% on its own?  For each of these other facilities, indicate the nature
% of the observations (yours or those of others), and describe the
% importance of the observations proposed here in the context of the
% entire program.
%
% 2) Do you currently have a grant that would provide resources
% to support the data processing, analysis, and publication of the
% observations proposed here?

\otherfacilities
We are proposing to obtain dense light curve coverage with LCO to
complement sparse, LSST-style coverage obtained with the Zwicky
Transient Factory, ZTF. The ZTF observations are expected to be
obtained approximately every three or four days, with two observations
in each night separated by approximately 30 minutes, continually over
several months. The University of Washington is a ZTF partner, thus we
can access both the public data (sampled at the rate described) and
the partnership data, which has the possibility of providing a
long-term light-curve sampled at a slightly higher rate (6 times per
night instead of 2). This will help us understand the level of
``sparse-ness'' which works best when combining dense and sparse
measurements.

\technicaldescription
We request dark or moon-down gray time for this proposal, as our
targets will be in the ecliptic and thus near the moon.

For each of our targets, we request continuous observations covering a
full rotation period (twice the light curve period). We will determine
periods and light curve profiles for potential targets using Gaussian
Process methods on the sparse ZTF data. We will select a subset of
approximately 10 targets with periods between 2 and 10 hours which
provide challenges to the Gaussian Process technique for observation
with LCO.  The chosen targets will be $r\le20$.

A SNR of 20 will allow us to resolve non-sinusoidal small amplitude
features in the light curve profile, and can be reached in a single
exposure on the LCO 1-m with Sinistro in 176 seconds during
`half' bright time or 124 seconds during dark time (estimated from the
LCO ETC). Including a readout + overhead time of 42 seconds per
exposure, we can sample the asteroid lightcurve on a timescale of 166
to 218 seconds, which provides a reasonable rate for these multi-hour
light curve periods.

For each asteroid, we would observe in a sequence of $\approx200$s
exposures, in either just $r$ band or in alternating $r$ and $g$,
depending on the details of the sparse light curve data obtained from
ZTF. The sequence would continue throughout two light curve periods
(as fit from the ZTF data) to unambiguously sample a full rotation
period.

By choosing a range of targets with an average light curve period of 6
hours, our total time requirement, including

% For example:
%
%  \targetsra{14 to 17}

\targetsra{9 to 0}			% RA range in hours
\targetsdec{10 to -30}			% Dec. range in degrees

% If you plan to submit any Target Tables for this run they must be
% entered here.  Target Tables are required for all queue runs.

% TARGET TABLES
%
% Target Tables are required for all queue runs and are
% are optional for classically scheduled runs.  Target
% Tables, if included, are associated with each run in the observing
% run details section of the proposal form and must follow the 
% \specialrequest in each section.
%
% CT-1.3m tables require that all the fields in the target table be
% specified.  For other tables specific fields may be deleted EXCEPT 
% for the \obscomment command as mentioned below.
%
% Queue investigators should supply good coordinates
% with the \ra and \dec commands since these values may be used to
% observe your fields.
%
% Note that for iterative targets, only the parameters that need
% to be changed have to be specified.  Once a parameter is specified in
% a targettable environment, it is retained until explicitly changed.
%
% The \obscomment command is REQUIRED for each target entry and
% must be the last item; this command forces each target line to be
% printed.  If no comment is needed, leave the argument blank.
%
% The \begin{targettable}{} command for each table must contain the
% telescope/instrument-detector information for that particular run,
% i.e,. \begin{targettable}{KP-4m/ECHUV + T2KB}.
%
% HINTS: Long tables do not break across pages. If it is necessary to
% continue a table across a page you must start a new table.  Use
% /clearpage before the \begin{targettable} command for the new table.
